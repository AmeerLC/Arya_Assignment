All the features of he dataset are continuous. <br />
The distribution of output variable is 60:40. <br />
The data is non normal and highly skewed. <br />
Dataset is of different scale, hence normalaisation has to be done. <br />
As the dataet is highly dimensional, top features has to be selected before proceeding to model building. <br />
